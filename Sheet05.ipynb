    "## Assignment 5: Scanpath [5 pts]\n",
    "We want to know whether different scan behaviour is used when viewing images of different categories. Scanpath is a path followed by the eyes when viewing a stimulus. Scanpaths are useful for analyzing cognitive intent, interest, and salience. It has an advantage to a heatmap because the information about temporal structure of viewing behaviour can be plotted.\n",
    "- make four plots, one for each category.\n",
    "- randomely choose one trial for which you will plot a scanpath.\n",
    "- mark fixation points based on the x-y coordinates.\n",
    "- plot the *saccade path* from one fixation point to another one.\n",
    "- make sure that the order of fixation can be read out from the plot. E.g. earlier fixations could have a light color whereas later fixations could have dark colors.\n",
    "- also include information about the duration of each fixation. One way to do it is the use the size of the fixation marker.\n",
    "- plot the background image superimposed with the scanpath. "
